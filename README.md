> Customisable Discord Rich Presence for Ateneo de Zoom University (ADZU) Students. Currently able to display ADZU Logo, Edit Details and State of Activity with either Preset Data, or custom-set by the user of the RPC-App. This app is still a console app to be run on command line / Terminal CLI, and it is still on its very early release. Lots of future developments and features have yet to come.

## Some Notes When Trying it out!

### Instructions:

> Git clone repo and cd to the repo on terminal
> Run "node ." or "node index.js" on cli

### Updates:

> CLI app with options to customise text displayed on ur rich presences
> Plan: Turn this to desktop util app with electron framework + database (for now preset datas are in the file mismo hehe)

Inspired from my python version of this app but just taught of making a js version of it hehe.
