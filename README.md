> Customisable Discord Rich Presence for Ateneo de Zoom University (ADZU) Students. Currently able to display ADZU Logo, Edit Details and State of Activity with either Preset Data, or custom-set by the user of the RPC-App. This app is still a console app to be run on command line / Terminal CLI, and it is still on its very early release. Lots of future developments and features have yet to come.

## Some Notes When Trying it out!

### Instructions:

> STILL IN EARLY DEV HEHE, SO NOT YET :/

### Updates:

> No Customisability Yet and CLI Feature

### Problems:

> No Broken Pipe Problem Tho ;)
> No CLI Version Yet

Inspired from my python version of this app but just taught of making a js version of it hehe.
